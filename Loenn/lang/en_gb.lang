You can take a look at how Communal Helper has them setup. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/arrow", where the arrow textures are located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/arrow/small00, small01... small15, same for med(00 - 15) & big(00 - 15).

There should be 3 textures in the folder you specified in the path, all of size 8x8, called: node.png, trackv.png, and trackh.png. The node.png texture is the point of intersection between tracks. trackv.png and trackh.png are the track horizontal & vertical textures, they should loop over seamlessly. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/tracks", where the texture are located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/tracks/node.png, trackv.png and trackh.png. This should point to a directory, not an image.

For instance: LEFT+RIGHT represents both the left and right button enabled, while the top one is off.\n\nThere are other keywords that represent multiple buttons at once: HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL, ALL, NONE:\n  * HORIZONTAL = LEFT + RIGHT\n  * VERTICAL = TOP\n  * ALL = TOP + LEFT + RIGHT\n  * NONE: (no buttons)\n\nIf you have multiple nodes, you must use the -> operator (a hyphen followed by a right-chevron, aka. "greater than") to indicate that whatever follows is for the next node.\nFor instance: LEFT+RIGHT -> TOP will start the block with the left and right buttons on, and when the blocks moves at the next node, only the top button will be on.\nYou don't necessarily have to write as many -> transitions as nodes this entity has, because the button sequence will just loop back if it reaches its end before the block ends its node sequence.\nYou must not have more transitions than nodes. In such a case, the extra button combinations are discarded.\n\nEvery word can be lowercase (they are case-insensitive).\nOther words that are not LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL, ALL, NONE, will be dismissed and a warning will be printed in the log.\nLeading & trailing whitespaces are discarded, so feel free to format the string the way you prefer.\n\nHere are more examples of valid sequences:\n  * LEFT\n  * HORIZONTAL -> TOP + LEFT\n  * right->left->tOP->All\n  * ALL -> none + LEFT+right -> rIgHt\n\nCheck the log if something goes wrong, you'll find the error messages there.

triggers.CommunalHelper/FollowShapeshifterPathTrigger.attributes.description.shapeshifterID=A comma-separated list of integer entity IDs of the Shapeshifter entities to move.

triggers.CommunalHelper/FollowShapeshifterPathTrigger.attributes.description.pathID=Optional field for specifying which path the Shapeshifter(s) will be borrowing. If this is left at -1, each Shapeshifter will look at the first path it finds in their bounds (rectangle).\nImportant: note that the movement along a path for a Shapeshifter is relative. The blocks don't teleport to the beginning of the path, but rather, they apply the movement of the path they follow, starting at their initial position.\nNote also that shapeshifters that are told to move while they are already moving will simply ignore the request, and keep moving along the path they were already following.
