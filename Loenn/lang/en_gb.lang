entities.CommunalHelper/StationBlock.attributes.description.customBlockPath=This is the path you should specify if you're using a custom texture for the block, leave empty for default textures. It looks for Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/<path>. The block should be a 24x24 texture, that preferably gets tiled correctly. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/custom_block", where the texture is located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/custom_block.png. DON'T add the ".png".
entities.CommunalHelper/StationBlock.attributes.description.customArrowPath=This is the path you should specify if you're using custom textures for the arrow, leave empty for default textures.

The first texture is the arrow pointing UP, the fifth pointing RIGHT, the ninth pointing DOWN, and the 13th pointing LEFT, the other sprites in between are the animation going from one direction to another. You can take a look at how Communal Helper has them setup. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/arrow", where the arrow textures are located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/arrow/small00, small01... small15, same for med(00 - 15) & big(00 - 15).

The node.png texture is the point of intersection between tracks. trackv.png and trackh.png are the track horizontal & vertical textures, they should loop over seamlessly. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/tracks", where the texture are located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/tracks/node.png, trackv.png and trackh.png. This should point to a directory, not an image.
