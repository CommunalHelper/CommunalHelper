The first texture is the arrow pointing UP, the fifth pointing RIGHT, the ninth pointing DOWN, and the 13th pointing LEFT, the other sprites in between are the animation going from one direction to another. You can take a look at how Communal Helper has them setup. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/arrow", where the arrow textures are located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/arrow/small00, small01... small15, same for med(00 - 15) & big(00 - 15). This should point to a directory, not an image.
entities.CommunalHelper/StationBlock.attributes.description.customTrackPath=This is the path you should specify if you're using custom textures for the tracks, leave empty for default textures. It looks for Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/<path>/node.png, trackv.png and trackh.png. There should be 3 textures in the folder you specified in the path, all of size 8x8, called: node.png, trackv.png, and trackh.png. The node.png texture is the point of intersection between tracks. trackv.png and trackh.png are the track horizontal & vertical textures, they should loop over seamlessly. Example: "catapillie/customStationBlock/tracks", where the texture are located at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/objects/catapillie/customStationBlock/tracks/node.png, trackv.png and trackh.png. This should point to a directory, not an image.

It is parsed by the entity, so this field must follow a specified format:\n\nFor each node, you can have the LEFT, RIGHT, and TOP buttons enabled or not.\nTo combine multiple buttons, use the + operator. For instance: LEFT+RIGHT represents both the left and right button enabled, while the top one is off.\n\nThere are other keywords that represent multiple buttons at once: HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL, ALL, NONE:\n  * HORIZONTAL = LEFT + RIGHT\n  * VERTICAL = TOP\n  * ALL = TOP + LEFT + RIGHT\n  * NONE: (no buttons)\n\nIf you have multiple nodes, you must use the -> operator (a hyphen followed by a right-chevron, aka. "greater than") to indicate that whatever follows is for the next node.\nFor instance: LEFT+RIGHT -> TOP will start the block with the left and right buttons on, and when the blocks moves at the next node, only the top button will be on.\nYou don't necessarily have to write as many -> transitions as nodes this entity has, because the button sequence will just loop back if it reaches its end before the block ends its node sequence.\nYou must not have more transitions than nodes. In such a case, the extra button combinations are discarded.\n\nEvery word can be lowercase (they are case-insensitive).\nOther words that are not LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL, ALL, NONE, will be dismissed and a warning will be printed in the log.\nLeading & trailing whitespaces are discarded, so feel free to format the string the way you prefer.\n\nHere are more examples of valid sequences:\n  * LEFT\n  * HORIZONTAL -> TOP + LEFT\n  * right->left->tOP->All\n  * ALL -> none + LEFT+right -> rIgHt\n\nCheck the log if something goes wrong, you'll find the error messages there.
